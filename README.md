# Amazon-s-insights....case study


Amazon India began its operation as a powerhouse of retailing in the US. They entered the Indian e-commerce market with their user-friendly website. They added many tiles and widened their product portfolios. They also created the ecosystem that was related to wholesale purchase of the products. Further, they tactically fixed the centers and contracts so that these goods can be easily shipped into and across the country. Amazon realized that more than a billion people in this coun- try have not been exposed to the e-commerce markets

The Indian market bore good as well as bad news for the company The good news was that more than 65% of the consumers were under the age of 35 years with a high percentage of disposable income, owned smart phones, and widely used the internet. The bad news was that 67% of Indian population still lived in the rural set up and had under-developed infrastructure. Further, only 35% of the Indian population had access to the internet. Customers preferred cash transactions to digital payments. FDI rules also restricted a foreign multibrand retailer to sell the products and goods di- rectly to the consumers through the digital channels. Thus, Amazon would need a third party seller for the Indian market. To do all these tasks and deal with complexities, Amazon had to understand strategic market research (Youderian, 2016).

BUSINESS ISSUES AND APPROACHES

Amazon needed the innovative business model to finalize ways to sell the products and goods in India. There was no shortage of the products that were manufactured and produced in India, but the vendors were small in scale. In this situation, a few e-retailers tried to seek the products online in India, but a cash-based economy model could not succeed in their businesses. To address these issues, Amazon launched their Indian website in 2013, and recruited suppliers as their partners to conduct business in India. They launched "Amazon Chai Cart. These mobile tea cants navigated on the streets of the cities, served refreshments, and educated the small business owners about the way e-commerce is used. This cart travelled 9,400 miles across 31 cities and involved 10,000 sellers. Subsequently, they launched "Amazon Tatkal" which was the "studio on wheels and provided var- lous services such as registration, imaging, cataloging, and training

They also used the centralized shipping platforms and developed around two dozens warehouses in India in Telangana. Amazon further introduced "easy ship" and "seller flex. Through these sys- tems, Amazon couriers picked the products from the seller's place and delivered to the consumers Subsequently, warehouses were designated for the courier and Amazon fully coordinated the delivery systems and logistics. This system was expedited by the "neighborhood approaches where it was easy for the seller to expedite the product delivery. The major delivery systems were contacted such


as India Post and Blue Dart. The company also developed the Amazon transportation services where bikes and bicycles were used to deliver in the urban and rural areas of India. However, there were challenges with the rural areas due to lower literacy rate and limited infrastructure

Interestingly, there were many Indians who were not ready to rely on online services and con- sidered mom-and-pop stores to be more convenient. There were issues related to internet services and basic infrastructure. However, all these concerns were addressed, and Amazon India achieved business to the level of $3 billion. This was due to the fact that there is very high potential in India, and the company was even ahead of the competitors, including Flipkart and Snapdeal (Sen, 2014).

► PROCESSES OF RESEARCH

These wonderful results were achieved by using effective approaches such as usage of appropriate key words for their brand which was commonly used by the consumers. This approach helped the company to reach out to consumers who were actually looking for online retailer or products. There were many up selling and cross selling carried out by the company with the help of the cookies and web beacons. The cookies provided the company with the customized data about the purchase history and other behavior patterns. Amazon provided these users very personalized offers based on their past history. This relevant information was approved of by the users. Additionally, they also worked on the presentation and packaging of the products. When consumers sent the products as gifts to another person, it was amazingly packaged and personalized. Further, Amazon also tracked the computers using the software. They used Chrome extension to track the history and received product details which helped them develop the subsequent competitive advantage strategy.

More specifically, all the challenges and issues were addressed by the company by conducting proper research. This research had many problems as we have seen. Thus, data was collected from various sources, including offline and online platforms and analyses was carried and these approach- es were developed. This research was in sync with the vision of a company which aims at providing customers with a satisfying experience. In line with this, they offered low prices and more alternatives and easy merchandizing. Thus, all the approaches of the company were customer centric. Subse quently, the marketing messages have to be offline and online channels with the aim of maximizing customer value proposition. Amazon provided easy to use functionality, quick and credible customer service with a variety of content and trust in every transaction (Chaffey, 2014, Ray et al., 2013).

►DATA COLLECTION METHODS

The company's website has customer reviews and product information that were in sync with the customer requirements. There were buying guidelines and free shipping offers offered by the company to increase the customer spend. In line with these, the company offered the latest inventory records and estimates of delivery dates with fast track delivery options. Further, the company used many tech- niques such as business Intelligence, machine object coaching, queueing systems, neural networks and so on to understand the consumers and make customer oriented strategies and approaches. The data from these methods were used at the boot camps that were organized for the top level management. In these camps, the focus was on understanding human behavior and its complexities.

Subsequently, with this robust research and festings, they worked on the re

Additionally, they ined to understand how the approaches allect their b This also meant that the "da" is king in the company, Amazon managed the details of all the actions at various stages online and displayed the status is the consumen. These data als helped the company bid for paid search advertising Aman also worked in the review conversion power by suing that each review was paid. Further search optimization and review count were also undertak by the company. They realized that high review is great, if it is in proportion to the new ove is outstanding Amazon realized that clicks do not work in these business. Thus, they had to go deeper and work on untapped markets. They modified the search and used to reach the stage of completion This meant that when the users typed something, it was filled by Amazon (Madden, 2012)

INITIAL BENEFITS BY RESEARCH

They also used research that helped the company to sell the products in the niche marken. Further, sellers can even work on the statured markets to earn high profits. Thus, Amazon worked on the in-depth reviews and more scientific market research that facilitated the company to track the prod ucts that were in demand. For this research, Amazon used "Jungle Scour. This software provided data about the revenue the company achieved on various products. Amazon essentially worked on data analytics and market research. In line with this, Jungle Scout was used as a research tool for the Amazon sellers, and it is a software product. This software collects data from different data points and facilitates the sellers Additionally, the company educated them with regards to the purchasing decisions. Therefore, they could identify excellent products that could be sold via Amazon

This software also worked on sales estimates as many users provided the data while making the purchase. It works on the "best sellers rank for which the algorithm is developed to track and mon itors at least a hundred thousand products. The best sellers rank also correlates the unit sales on a monthly basis. Additional algorithm is created to get this update every month, which provides the sales estimates to Amazon and how they are performing on their business metrics (Sen, 2016).

EXTENDED TECHY METHODS FOR RESEARCH

More importantly, Amazon used "Splidy and Review Kick", which acquired the reviews and man- ages them on the platforms. Thus, if the user would like to receive the reviews about the Amazon product, they could get this information from the review option. Here, several coupons are being provided to the real buyers for the review that they have carried out for Amazon. Thus, Amazon received reviews that were really effective and legitimate. This tool was initially a product research tool, which has moved to a suite tool for the Amazon sellers.

Subsequently, there is the Amazon selling machine that provided tremendous information about the which was the initial thought of the company. They have moved from offline products to products online on Amazon. It means that Amazon has changed the way data needs to be looked at and considered for the business decision. This new business perspective changed the entire pleth- ora of the products that Amazon offers. They offered products from gloves, yoga mat and so on. The company also looked at those products that enjoyed heavy demands by the consumers. The

products are not too competitive and have multiple reviews. If the products are stanared, it is very

challenging for the company to get into that market However, products, such as barbeque gloves or garlic paste, would be easier for the company to get into the market. These products are considered as cool and user-friendly by the consumers. They are less competitive and have more and better business opportunities

To ensure this, there is keyword search on Google, this platform is connected to the revere

and Jungle Scout. As it monitors the demand and the sales. For example, il a user is searching for

a water bottle, this software will provide the data which could state that three sellers are in the top

10 results category and have 50 reviews. More importantly, Amazon encapsulates the overall listing

which may include private labels. Amazon focuses a lot on keyword research as it is significantly connected to the number of units sold To strengthen the search, Amazon uses Merchant words-the algorithm which relates the Google key words to the sales. Conventionally, Amazon related the search with the products, but it was not making any sense in terms of the business decision. The integrated search, which is associated with Google of the search, is important for the company. This resulted in increasing the bottom line of the company

However, the most challenging part for Amazon is to sell the non-differentiated products as white labelling (re-branding and marketing the products by the company to ensure that they are their own in spite of the fact that they manufactured and developed by the other company) do not work for the consumers anymore. Products have to be exclusive and of excellent quality (Bhasin, 2017).

RACE FRAMEWORK

In line with the same. Amazon works on the RACE framework which means: (1) Reach: it is derived from the AdWords and key words

(2) Act: develop simple and transparent experiences by thorough testing

(3) Convert: customize and provide relevant recommendations

(4) Engage: involve and engage with the users

This approach leads to "customer obsession" and is always evaluated and monitored thoroughly by the company. To do so, Amazon conducts many experiments. They developed internal exper- imentation platforms, which are known as "weblab". This platform was used by the company to assess the improvements in the company's website and products. They also added a feature known as "ask an owner" where the user can ask the questions related to the products. And amazon can route these queries to the relevant sellers or owners. Further, real-time experiments were also con- ducted where page design, features, ranking, relevance of ranking and so on were studied. However, the research was conducted for a few days or a week. This was because the company wanted to understand the pulse of the business in terms of session time, length, and so on. The overall online experience was also assessed with the statistical methods.

In line with the same, Amazon uses the data derived from this research for:

(1) Enhancing the website traffic

(2) Increasing awareness about the products

Cheating incremental products and oppomanes Sincang revenue for the a (4) Strongly developing the "Amazon brand

These approaches were used by the company because they believed that ca campaigns and communication also enhanced the customer experience which is the c jective for their business. These communications helped the company develop ewond of r marketing and word of mouth which help allure new customers and getting repeat purchases hom the existing customers. Further, the company also connected with the customer based their interest areas and helped them selecting the products that were in sync with their needs and rements. More specifically, they conducted online advertising which included paid search marketing, search optimization-mails campaigns and interactive ads. The data also helped Am ason to create leaflets for the

non-competing websites such as Expedia, Makemytrip and so on Interestingly, Amazon found that a significant number of customers who have downloaded their app and visited their site did so mainly through their smart phones in India. This change in the user behavior encouraged the company to develop mobile-oriented user experience, as the screen was small. They made their interface more user oriented. Thus, this orientation could be easily used on their phones. Consumers were easily able to track their products via these app This resulted in a fivefold increase in the sales as compared to the competitor Le. Flipkart. They also launched the grocery service with a delivery time of 2 hours. This further enhanced the shops ping experience of the consumers in India (Chaffey, 2016).

▸ DATA AND FINDINGS USAGE

This consumer-oriented data were used by the company in three different ways (1) Relationship marketing driven by Data: This was undertaken by Amazon with the big data and web search for all the customer transactions. The data were shared with the call center. Based on this, they understood the customer relevance and context. Thus, they interacted specifically based on what the customer was interested in. Additionally, there is the facility of opt in and out for the customer for the promotional messages from Amazon. These approaches helped Amazon enhance the relationship with the customers.

(2) High ease of Shopping: The comprehensive data helped the company increase the ease and convenience of the online shopping for the customers. There were many technological platforms by which customer were able to access the information very quickly. There were "one-click ordering" dash buttons were installed at home where the push of button can result in shopping. Further, the Amazon Prime facility was provided to the customers to receive the coupon based on their location and time of the day or event.

(3) Exquisite Experience: The data helped the company to enhance the social and online expe rience of the customers. The social element was taken care of by the relationship marketing team of Amazon as they were free to share their opinions and experience with their family and friends easily. Amazon also encouraged a continuous feedback process to improve their performance.

More specifically, the research data also faciluated the company in increasing their B2B apart from enhancing the B2C category. They signed up with Aditya Birla Group's mine ma fashion store. This collaboration helped the company to enhance their offerings in the test case gory and wider options were provided to the customers. There was more margin for the buses this category (Warrillow, 2015; "Relationship Marketing for amazon.com -O21", 2017)

►WAY AHEAD

India is very nascent in e-commerce, video streaming, and cloud computing. Yet, there are multiple opportunities in this country. This is because there are 1.3 billion people, which is four times the Us population. The country is growing at an annual rate of 5%-10%. Indians are conversant in Engla Further, there is a high penetration of smart phones in the country and shipping is cheaper in Ind as compared to the US. There is a prediction that by 2020, there will be 175 million shoppen i the online retailing space. This means the business would be extended by US$ 100 billion. Mobile wallet and credit cards would increase further business. However, India needs more investment ter only in currency abut also in patience and perseverance in dealing with the infrastructure coupled with a long-term perspective. The complexities of culture, preference, liking, and consumer beha lor are really complex and dynamic. Thus, this country needs constant and continuous researh so understand and provide excellent customer experience to all its consumers across the country (Shah, 2016).
